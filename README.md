This is a small React app that I created to practice concepts with minimal focus on UI and UX.

How to start the app:
set "REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=api_key" && npm start


This app uses The Open Weather Map API: 
https://openweathermap.org/current

install new packages: 
1) add package
2) run npm install
